# Mini_project
## IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING
### K NEAREST NEIGHBOR ALGORITHM

In this project KNN algorithm is used for the classification of images of flowers and 4 different types of flowers are considered for this project are:</br>
1) Rose
2) Sunflower
3) Daisy
4) Marigold

The 5 steps involved in any image classification problem are as follows:</br>
1) Gathering of data
2) Pre-processing of data
3) Classification using the suitable and best algorithm
4) Model prediction, confusion matrix and Classification report

The above steps have been implemented in this project and the python notebook is attached for the same in :

The downloaded images are available :
