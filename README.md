## IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING
### K NEAREST NEIGHBOR ALGORITHM

In this project KNN algorithm is used for the classification of images. The data that is considered for this project is flowers and 4 different types of flowers are considered for this project, namely:</br>
1) Rose
2) Sunflower
3) Daisy
4) Marigold

The 5 steps involved in any image classification problem are as follows:
1) Gathering of data
2) Pre-processing of data
3) Classification using the suitable and best algorithm
4) Model prediction, Confusion matrix and Classification report
5) Prediction for new images

The above steps have been implemented in this project as well.</br>

The Repository contains the following files:</br>
1) **Images** : Contains 50 images of each flower type along with the new images to be predicted.
2) **Image_Classification.ipynb** : python notebook with the code
